# Airbnb Listings in European Cities - A Data Visualization Project

This is a group project developed as a part of the Data Visualization course from the Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at NOVA IMS. The objective was to create an interactive dashboard showcasing Airbnb listings across different European cities. The dashboard incorporates visualizations to explore metrics such as host information, pricing trends, and geographical distribution of listings.
The project was developed using plotly and dash within a python environment. The final result can be seen in [here](https://data-viz-project.onrender.com/).
